        <font size='4'> So, this is my school,<b> Children Academy,Varanasi</b>(My hometown is Varanasi).I have completed my 10th(with 9.2 cgpa) as well as my 12th(with 75%) from this school only.My school is 1km away from my sweet home.But still I reach late most of the times.😅 I remeber the <font color='red'>first day of my school</font> when I cried a lot because I don't want to go there but then I met<font color='blue'> Komal</font>, she was sitting on the bench next to my bench.She talked to me before and help me getting my copies done.😁 Then she started coming to my house and I go to her house for playing games.<br />
          Time passes slowly and I make new friends.Now, when I was in Class 8 & 9 I got two more friends<font color='blue'>Anchal</font> <b>&</b><font color='blue'> Sana.</font>
          Anchal, Sana and I exchange juicy gossipon on who has a crush on whom🤣(Iknow you all have done these kind of stuffs in our school life).<br />
          Then when I went from <font color='red'>class 9 to class 10</font>, there I met a strict coordinator of our school(Mr.Vikas Mishra) who used to teach mathematics in our class.So, everyone joined his coaching because we don't have any other option left.😥<br />
          their, I met <font color='blue'>Muskan</font> who joined coaching with me so we started going to coaching together.We share lots of memories together.After that she opted COMMERCE and I opted SCIENCE, so our path diverge a bit as we don't share common background.<br />
          Then I met<font color='blue'> NEHA </font>in class 11, we use to go coaching together.She is very helpful and genuine in nature.💜</font>

Okay, then I am <font color='red'>closing my School life content.</font><br />
