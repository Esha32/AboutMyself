    <font size='5'>So the things I like most are:
    <ul>
      <li>
      <h3> FOOD:</h3>
      </li>
    <p>
       Being a foodie isn't just about food. It's about how the food, makes you feel. For me, each<font color='crimson'> meal is a celebration.</font>🧁<br />
      You just need a partner with you to accomplish your job in helping you out in your foodie crime and you are almost done!💗
      My favourite dishes include Dosa, Golgappa, Chilli-paneer with fried rice, Babycorn.</p>
      <li>
      <h3> SHOPPING:</h3>
        </li>
  <p>
      A <font color='crimson'>whole day shopping </font>is the dream of every girl. For some people, if they are feeling sad, shopping will make them happier because it restores some control in their lives.<br />
        And most of the girls love to own new things that attract attention of people's around.🎀</p>
    <li><h3>
      Love being photographed:</h3>
    </li>
    <p> I <font color='crimson'>love to be photographed</font> and to give different poses.📸
    </ul>
